# SmartWebTool

**SmartWebTool** is an open-source community that designs and develops web tools to help people simplify complex aspects of everyday life.

Our focus is on **clarity, usefulness, and accessibility**: transforming administrative, analytical, or data-heavy problems into intuitive web applications that people can actually understand and use.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Modern life is full of hidden complexity: social benefits, healthcare costs, administrative rules, family data, legal structures, and more.  
SmartWebTools exists to **reduce cognitive and technical friction** by:

- Making complex rules transparent
- Turning raw data into meaningful insights
- Providing tools that are easy to use, explain, and verify
- Keeping everything open, auditable, and community-driven

---

## 🧠 What We Build

SmartWebTools develops **independent, reusable web applications**, each focused on a well-defined real-world problem.

### Examples of current tools

#### 🏥 Healthcare premium reduction estimator
A web tool that allows users to:
- Evaluate whether they are eligible for a healthcare premium reduction
- Estimate the expected reduction amount
- Understand *why* they are eligible or not, based on transparent criteria

The goal is not only to compute a result, but to **explain the reasoning behind it**.

#### 🌳 Genealogy visualization tool
A genealogy web application that:
- Imports standard **GEDCOM** files from any genealogy software
- Generates exceptionally **condensed family tree views**
- Makes it possible to display **hundreds of families** on:
  - a single A3 page, or
  - a small number of A4 pages

This tool is designed for readability, printing, and large-scale family overviews rather than decorative charts.

## 🧩 Design Principles

Across all projects, we follow a shared set of principles:

- **Open source first** – code, algorithms, and assumptions are visible
- **Explainability** – results should be understandable, not opaque
- **Minimalism** – no unnecessary features, no visual noise
- **Portability** – tools should be easy to deploy and reuse
- **Longevity** – favor simple, maintainable solutions over trends

---

## 🎨 Visual Identity

Each SmartWebTools project uses a shared visual identity:
- A common logo representing **clarity, assistance, and insight**
- Consistent design language across tools
- Neutral, professional aesthetics suitable for public-facing services

The logo is included in each tool to signal:
> “This tool is part of the SmartWebTools ecosystem.”

## 🤝 Community & Contributions

SmartWebTools is a **community-driven organization**.

Contributions are welcome in many forms:
- Code (frontend, backend, data processing)

## 🔓 License

All projects under the SmartWebTools organization are released under open-source licenses.  
See individual repositories for license details.

## 🌍 Why Open Source?

Because tools that influence personal decisions—healthcare, finances, family history—**must be inspectable and trustworthy**.

Open source is not a slogan here; it is a design constraint.
